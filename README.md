## 🤖 Fundamentals of Machine Learning

Welcome to my Fundamentals of Machine Learning repository! Here, you will find a collection of basic algorithms and concepts in the field of machine learning that I have learned and compiled during my own journey of learning. 🚀

## 📚 Algorithms Covered
This repository covers the following fundamental algorithms of machine learning:

Linear Regression 📈

Logistic Regression 📉

Decision Trees 🌳

Random Forests 🌿

k-Nearest Neighbors 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

Support Vector Machines 🦾

Naive Bayes 🤔

Principal Component Analysis 🧐

k-Means Clustering 🧮

Each algorithm has been implemented using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

🚀 Usage
To use the algorithms in this repository, simply clone the repository and run the Python files for each algorithm. Each file includes sample datasets and comments to help you understand how the algorithm works and how to tweak it to fit your own needs.

🤝 Contributions
I created this repository as a way to solidify my own understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning, but I would love to hear from others who have different perspectives or approaches. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or want to contribute your own implementation of an algorithm, please feel free to open an issue or pull request! 🤗

Thank you for checking out my Fundamentals of Machine Learning repository, and I hope you find it helpful in your own journey of learning. 🙌
